# Ian's Solutions to Advent of Code 2017

Each December, [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) publishes [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com), a series of programming puzzles. These are my solutions to the 2017 puzzles, written in F#.

**Note:** if you are wondering what the `=!` operator is in each of my solutions, this comes from [Swenson Unquote](https://github.com/SwensenSoftware/unquote). It's an assertion, and I use it to verify that my code produces the correct output for each of the example inputs in the problem description. I use it because when an assertion fails, it will automatically report exactly what expression failed, and how. (It uses F#'s expression system to inspect the assertion, enabling it to provide detailed errors.)
